# Storyteller's Cinema

**Storyteller's Cinema** transforms your Foundry VTT sessions into an immersive **visual novel experience**. It creates a seamless "Cinematic Mode" where the map is replaced by a scenic background, tokens become high-quality portraits, and the camera dynamically adapts to tell your story—all while keeping the tactical map just a click away.
